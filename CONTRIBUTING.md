=============================

No contributions are expected. However, if you spot something you'd like to fix, follow these steps:

1.   Fork the repository

2.   Create an appropriately named branch from develop for what you are going to do.
     
     In the case of bugfixes, name this bugfix/issuenumber
     
     In the case of features, name this feature/issuenumber

3.   Open a pull request for your changes to be merged back into develop. If they are acceptable, I'll accept the pull request. If not, I'll give you some feedback as to why your changes were not accepted.

Thanks for your help!
